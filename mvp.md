- data: creation in jupyter notebooks / to_scripts
    reference_data (model trained on)
    new_data (to run labeling and to detect drifts)

- model: experiment tracking
    - creation in jupyter notebooks / to_scripts
    - experiment tracking in mlflow, locally
    - model registry locally, sqlite

- no pipe
- no deploy

- monitoring: evidently: data drift and silouhette score, locally in notebooks

- no reproducibility

- best practice:
    - pre-commit hooks: large_files / private_key
    - TBD black
